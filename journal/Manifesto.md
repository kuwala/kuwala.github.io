# Manifesto for a better Daniel.

Try to improve and enrich Other peoples lives
Do ScreenTime Everyday. Computers!
Check in with yourself and yourgoals.
Improve 1% but dream big and big and big
* Shifting the target is not a problem if you keep accuiring improvements.
Things you do make you who you are not what you remember
