who knows what the fuck is going on...
i am getting more and more down the rabbit hole.
going on several smoking sessions and monitoring
my passages through out the possibility spaces before me.


teh ultamite todo list:

--i seemed to have gotten distracted, but probably by something good like art
drawing or making sprites---

But then when I unplug and remain in the normal world for too long I seem to get
depressed about things. Worried, worried so much that I feel bad. Yesterday I had a
pretty good day. But when I spent it thinking about the project I really worried
and depressed and scared to fail. I want to do a really good job. But I think that
our structure that we make for the pink noise install has a high chance of failing
or sucking. ... I worry that matt does not want to do it. Or maybe he does not have
the time to make it good. Or maybe he does not have the skills, or maybe he thought
that I knew what to do. First night that we talked we divided up the tasks into 
hardware / install (matt), and software and electronics(meee). 


keep thinking about HOW good it NEEDS to be, how good it should be .... when I show my
projects to people. even if they are very impressed. I keep thinking about how good
it should be...and what I do is I think okay this cool thing took me really only 1
day to make. Say the midi light box I made for john. That allows you to plug in a
usb midi device into it and then each midi note will trigger a stripe of color to
appear on flexible led display that is inside the clear box.
