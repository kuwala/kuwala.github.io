LA TRIP

Thursday night arrived in LA. 5-24-18
Amalia took us to "conners" on ergot street. It was simmilar to a deli.
We meet and ate with Andrew and Shane. Andrew worked a lot in visual effects.
Liked collecting pirated mac games and operated a bbs. He worked on stuert littel and cat in the hat.
He now works on some kind of startup that will use machine vision and ai for movies.

Friday.
Amalia goes to work and I go to Griffith Observatory. From 10am - 2:30pm. I sit and decorate her gift wrap for an hour.
Then I explore and listen to podcasts for an hour and sit and water color paint the gift wrap. She packed me cheese and
crackers and trail mix and even gave me a chocolate bar.

Then we go to Museam of Jurrasic Technology. Meet Jed. Explored lots. Then we go to in and out burger.
I have a animal style cheese burger with a strawberry milkshake.

Then we go to a Music show at the Masonic Lodge. Its really pretty building with cool LA vibes. I liked the Cool Maritime's visuals
and music. Melodic and simple. Lots of a palm trees and a Cemetary around the area.

We return home and she shows me some books and wiggly art.

Sleep around 1:30am

Saturday:
