    <p>I finnally went and saw my dad and serge yesterday. I fetl really good
      I was really missing them. I wounder if That is a part of my saddness
      I that I really end up missing them and feel helpless and hopless in
      my situation to get to see them. I get urgess to be back home all the time.
      But I cant fufill them. I wish I could see my mom more. Its going to be
      really nice to have her live in portland again so that I can come vist her.
      </p>

      <p>Today I talked to her and she got a shitsu that she really wanted. she
      seemed much happier then before. I remember when serge and I visited her
      this last time her house was in a really good shape. She didn't live in
      the clutter that I imagined she lived in. My worries of her having a terrible
      life are actually over exadurated and she is not doing too bad.</p>

      <p>I was feeling really down the last couple of days and I think I am
        starting to bounce back. It feels alright again and some how manageable.
        Before I was worried about making choices and having this free time with
        nothing planned. Now I am starting to plan out my days again. And its only
        going to ramp up and get more busy in may. Hopefully I can finish the
        the two projects I have taken on.</p>

      <p>The Solder Doodle Plus is going to be a new kind of challenge but
        I felt a really strong scarryness to commit to it and wanting to back out
      but those feelings are starting to fade and I feel allright about it. Even
        starting to look forward to it a bit. There are a lot of unkowns to doing
        it but possibly</p>
