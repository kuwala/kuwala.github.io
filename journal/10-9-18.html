    <h1>Put out the things I am making</h1>
    <p> Brad reminded me this fine 2am evening that I need to put my work out there.
    Even if its in an inprogress state. I have known this but its good to be
    reminded of it. When I Reflect on this weekend and question why was I so
    dang sad on friday or on sunday. The answer is that I see my friends moving
    doing the things they want and moving forward while I just make plans
    to move forward but then get distracted and abandon them and move on to
    something else.

    <h2>Upload the Cellular Automata Game to mysite and itch.io</h2>
    <p>Brad encouraged me to upload my finished game to the internet</p>
    <p>well instead of just being sad. I downloaded and played cellautomta
    and started to install and setup iterm2. cool. I feel a tiny bit better.</p>
