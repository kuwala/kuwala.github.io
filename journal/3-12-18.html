    <h2>Work towards being hireable for web dev work!!</h2>
    <h2>New Relic <3 ?? </h2>
    <p>I really want to start using something like HAML. Primarly to use it
    to use variables for paths for my css and javascript links. That I think I am too tired
    to start doing that right now but soon! Also this is an oppertunity to install
    and use a bit of ruby. This could be my chance to even learn a bit of ruby
    on rails. Soundcloud and Twitch are made with it ! that rocks I would love
    to do some interface design for either of those companies. Or even just our
    local company NewRelic. They work with ruby on rails, they seem like areally
    rad company to work for and it could be good meaningful work!! I could dig that!
    plus I get to learn a lot of new techy stuff that is up my ally. Maybe I can
    use ruby on rails and audio js librarys to make my site into an app. My site
    should always be somekind of app. I would love to continue learning more web
    app parts. </p>
    <p>What I know so far is a bit for node.js some angular (although i forgot
    a good portion of it.) javascript, jquery a little bit, css, bootstrap a bit,
    </p>
