    <h1>Dananiel's Deep-rrression</h1>
    <p>Okay</p>
    <p>I am going to tune into myself and listen to the things I am worried and</p>
    <p>and anxious about with an instructional out look. Hey its not so bad!
    Yes I am not a perfect person and I have flawss and worries but its going to
    okay no matter what choice I make and because I had these worriesome feelings
    and ideas I can make better choices.</p>
    <p>I often paniced and jumped to conclusions or ultimates that ended up not
    true. Or were atleast definitely not as bad. Sometimes errors were made. feelings
    Were heard. Hopes and dreams were shattered. But we keep going. We pick ourselves
    back up and we keep trying. Being depressed and sad all the time really stinks,
    and its not useful. But atleast it can be instructional. Maybe just maybe things
    still have a possibility to turn out for the better, and thats what I need to
    seak out. </p>
    <p>I want to be hopefull and Helpfull to my humanself. And to other people.
    For that I need to work hard. No one else is going to do it.</p>
    <h2>Sphinx Cat</h2>
    <p>The few things I have worked hard on have turned out great. There was
    anxiety building to them. But in the end I percerviered and escaped with
    great value and seeing people get happy was super sweet!</p>
    <p>I should try and share with others my success more. Maybe I can show Andy
    my sphinx cat game. </p>
    <h2>My mom</h2>
    <p>It does not matter where I am physically in life. As long as I work hard
    to complete my dreams. I need more GUTS said some girl in sams email.hehehe.
    and I thought thats not trueee... But it is true. I need more guts. What am
    I fighting for? I am fighting for love and peace, duh. Through my own work
    It can be hard but it will be beautiful. Lets stay up late working drawing.
    Living. Squizing the juice out of life.</p>
