# Getting the hang of linux again
Yesterday, Today and days around this time have been a bit really good recently.
I have had a fundamental change in how I am approaching life. Once again I am in
it to have fun and do all the things I ever wanted to do. 

I have meet up with friends and pushed myself to do things I am interested in.
The goal I have right now is to keep pushing myself, go out of the house a lot
try and do as much of the good things that I wanted to do. Keep trying
hell yeah things are gonna be hard. They are supposed to be hard. The things
I am interested in doing are not easy things. And I am not a particurarly
proficent person. But I am a very persistent person if I want to be.
