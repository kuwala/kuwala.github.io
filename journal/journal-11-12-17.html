          <h1>Need for Modules</h1>
          <p>I need to turn all my projects into modules that are playable by me.
            so that I can use them to play with. I can use them to show stuff off
            to people. If I can plat with them I can then use them to do better more
            Interesting things. So Tidying up my modules fixing them and bringing
            them forward to the future that I want is important so that they grow
            along with me. I am learning various ways to document and do stuff.
            I need to seperate my journaling mess into some areas of interest and
            then begin to slowly collect the lumpy bits into a pile and then
            watch them grow and interact.

          <p>These kinds of behavoirs and activies would be really interesting fun
             and allow me to engage with my fellow developers in special ways.
