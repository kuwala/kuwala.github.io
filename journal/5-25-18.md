# Amalias great Los Angelos
I have arrived.
What are my goals for los angelos? To work on creative things every day.
Draw and doodle things and make some sonic art. I also want to try to make a game. Yikes man
I have a lot on my plate. I also broaght an LED strip too. Man I did I bring too much? Probably not.
I also want to read seconds and the over the garden wall comic amalia wrote.

I want to be productive what should I do...
Lets review where we left off at with the LED project.

Check into unity. Open it up. Make a list of the assets I need to make.

I also have KiCad I can explore and begin to learn.

Led project

Lots lots lots lots lots to do.
