          <h1>Hiked with Sam</h1>
          <p>
            Having only slept 4am - 7:30am, I was a bit tired getting to sams
            house. He made me tasty breakfast with Egg sandwich and toast.
            Then we drove out to the Gorge. The first place we tried on the
            Oregon side, Michenlyn Point, was closed. Dunno why, maybe do to fire
            damage from earier. We drove back a bit and took bridge of the gods
            and drove west on the washington side to Wind Mountain. We thought we
            found the main trail but it was definetly off trail we hiked up,
            and it was one of the most difficult hikes we ever had because it was
            super steap and nota real trial so though small brush and spike
            branches. Eventually near the top we found the main trail. As we hiked
            up from behind a sign that was asking people to be respectful and not
            damage any artifacts or land. At one point it looked like our faint trail
            fallowed some spots where people or dear or both have once walked
            but very vew and there were no big paths just time steps occationaly
            and some dirt spots where you have to activally balance to stay standing.
          <p>
          <p>Once we got ot the top there were two kids a mom chilling on tree over
          looking / looking out on the town to the west (i think) and in front
          of them there was a mountain edge with thing sheets of rock slabs. The
          native americans used these slabs to make small trenchs and walls where
          they made shelters for their young to spend the night along their journey
          to adult hood and find their gardian spirit. Some of the trenchs still
          looked like they were being used.
          </p>
          <p>we smoked and relaxed in the sun for a while, eat dry top ramen and
          some chips. I talked about shaping things and how I want to make 3d
          modules to build 3d things out of...plently of more stuff. I did lots
          of audio recordings. Recodred a chipmonk try to sneak some food from us.
          and even got out my box of shapes and played with it for a bit and
          did a page of journaling. It got cold, and began to darken so we left.</p>
          <h2>At sams home</h2>
          <p>on the way home to Sam's we stoped by and I bought a cheese pizza
            mushrooms, kale, 2 apples.$15 We made pizza, kale chips, apples and cheese.
            burnt the first batch of kale chips. 10min is a good amount. not 20.</p>


            <h2>Sam played Super Mario Oddysy</h2>
            <p> He was quit surprised by the game mechanics and the swithc itself.
              Afer games we went to the hottub for 30min and then just talked
            for like an hour and I feel asleep around midnight</p>
            <p>I woke up around 4:30am and then worked on Daniel's Batchler Jam
              for a bout an hour. Listening to it, Time coding it, and writing notes.
              I had an idea to make it into an album type present for Daniel.</p>
            <p>Its 6:40am I am going to sleep again for a few hours. hehehe
            good night future me....</p>
