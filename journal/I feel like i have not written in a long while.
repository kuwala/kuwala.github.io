# Scroll ~ a journal by yours truely
I feel like i have not written in a long while.
----------------------------------so now I write a long file

Its been quiet some time between writing and working on thoughts and medias. of verious types.
I often think in conversations with myself. I have been supressing them as noise. Telling myself to not
think those. Kind of telling myself to shutup.

Where am i floating too.

Writing is such a creative composition that feels great. But I don't really do it a whole lot. Is this going
to become a todo list? I feel like I am cursed to make todolists with more things on them than I will 
ever get to. 

I want to engage in make...went to go plug in my phone and I reconfigured 
my seating and lots of my train of thought. lets rewind.

Meditation

Im sitting in a room.

my room.

writing a scroll.

practice ... it is

there are pleanty things i could be doing ,,,

but i choose this.

listen to good relaxing music.

sitting warmly and comfortably

making some thing. engaging with the world.

ergonomics.....<---

thinking, thinking, thinking

...

making a list again

not again, no its not a list.

i dont really know what this is.

its a lot of small little words.

thoughts layedout on paper.

except paper is long gone and we have went all digital and hte mediouns 
of this day and age have long extended into the etherial realm of data
this is data. useless, maybe, probably. junk data. garabage. hoarding.
anti-minimalism. a mess to bless. a remix of cultured htoughts 
misspellings and mis communications of things t ocome. and yet..

Its like a long book all written and shot in one go.

long form. <-----------------------------------------------------------

there can be some kind of narative or something special here. can be.

and what if I never go back. never look up. it all passes just like time

just like us. we are all passing each other by each and everyday. most

people with out a connection or interaction. 

... ... ...

sometimes not knowing where I am going is pleasent... an element of danger
and adventure is glued onto every journey. every real travel is mystory
and s u r p r i s e

its 3:47am and now I sleep,
$100 worth of leds and cables
icovet new friendships
and drool over TE 400 synths



now now the i
and now the ideas flow

--- -- journal entry -- ---[1] 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0 ---------

my website should just become a serious of screenshots
and interactions with screenshots -- --- a prototype 

I can then began to animate the screenshots in verious ways
every post should be a journey through the journal entrie.

and the entries -- should maximize things I have done and said.
currently what I am thinking ... useless and mondane things.

because thats what most of it is
and we gotta make the most of it

--- -- --- ----- --- ---------- -------------- -------------------

I am swimming in my own thoughts... ugh why is it always about me..
Lets generating new thoughts! New styles of thinking and playing...
Paying attention to the mediums of life and meaningfulness that things
can have.

I really like the minimap on the right in sublime. Its really cool to
a gist or a loose sketch of text density and colors to

I am not worried about where I have been or what I have done.
Im worried about where I am going, and what I will do there.
Because that place does not exist and things I will do are 
unplanned and impromtu, improvosations of life.  we are all
playing it by ear

## [01] - Candles are Light Fixtures

Candles are generative light sculptures that you bring around with you.
They flicker and randomize the light direction a little bit. The base
glows solid and opaqe but after a littel while the wax melts and the base is transparent. 

Some one later went and invented the lava lamp.

## [02] - Scroll Values

-------- Scroll is a journal-festo -------
Its a kind of journal that I can play along with you.
It simulates and listens to words you type. It will play
with your words and journal activities. Its values :
-create a playful environment
-- provide easy minimalist modern tools for making intresting texts.
-- one continuous scroll-space (2d?)
-- Scroll is a book a textual philosophical journey.
-- 

## [03] - a 2d text based game. with physics.
My list of game ideas / components of things I want to
work on. 
-- top down view.
-- maybe a grid
-- or maybe everything has spring physics
-- use super minimalist art assets.
-- inspired by teenage engineerings art phylosopies
-- use led strips as display. make the display into a sculpture
-- text boxes only as art assets - with physics and they can move in 2/3D
-- fractal dimensions ? 
One non-trivial example is the fractal dimension of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but it is by no means a rectifiable curve: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional.[7] Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which is often a number between one and two; in the case of the Koch snowflake, it is about 1.262

"always mount a scratch monkey" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_monkey

after doing some video art. 

I remebred how the op-1 and op-z were really good investments. and so I purchased the POM 170. $360 :D well spent.

Its 7:49am I sent a text to my manager asking to come in at 12.

The sun has just about come up. I think I will go look around and return to bed at 8:30.
