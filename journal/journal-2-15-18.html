            <p>Now we are talking. I can finally journal in my coding
            environment. This feels pretty good. </p>
            <p> I need to set this up so that I upload a picture to it Every
            time too.</p>
            <p>I am also going to weave my own hypertext structure with
            all these note webpages. They are a bit weird right Now
            and are mostly a collection of my feelings and poourly organized
            thought. But in a way having a personal website that keeps growing
            and changing is really cool. Its progress and content is all archived
            it has taken be a few years to develop and get this far.
            It has definietly become my journal of thoughts and practice with
            web development. As I am brining p5js and more programming into thea
            mix it will become my computation and programing expperimentations
            too. All these things intermix to create a journal that is my personal
            journey and cronical of things I do.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Post pictures / content with each post.</li>
