What Bogus dimension did I fall into?

Primitive feelings - despair returns...
As time is splited away and is pushed down
and down untill its barried. Barried under
a pile of digital djunk. Such Pasteie Parts
are trying to evoke. I write and I write.
But No one reads. No one will read. Its not
proficient enough. Not polished. But it is 
my stream of conciousness. Useless.
Its not useful for anyone. Not even the future self.

For it is not something That I return to and re-read.

My feelings and thoughts are garbage.
Today I left a Mt.dew can of soda open and partialy drunk. Now its got some pretty
little metalic percusive clings. Its got them
for me. A procedural ? no generative sound 
instullation for one laxy person. :()

Its stupid.

I went to bed early. But I ended up browsing the web.
 It was a well needed activity. I have not been using the computer eenough lately.
