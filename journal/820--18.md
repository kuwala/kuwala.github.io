A quick divergentce of my daily duities has taken me onto a "sfsdfg" journey
to the safe edges of the interesting thigs on the web.

4:30pm-8:30pm
I worked on getting a running prototype for the hardware controller.
I accomplished getting the circuit together on a breadboard and then writing
some code the test the rotatry encoders and getting buttons and pots to
out put joystick data over usb. THe encoders still need help as my code seems
to have a bug.

I am measuring the distance the encoder has been rotated and using that to apply
move the joystick into a direction then I am slowly restoring the joystick
to the center position over some time. But its being buggy and not working how
I would like it to work.

Having lots of things open is kind of a pain in the butt! and this atom editor is
bein a bit laggy...toobad..

At the same time I also torrented some Anime. Kill la Kill and One Punch Man and
Devilman Crybaby and Lu over the wall. I also downlaoded some hudson mowhake
albums. Cool.

I then some how started to browse the web. Enjoyed my stay on some neocities sites
and quickly got sucked into esoteric and abstract art.

Also in the mean time I downlaoded Citra and someones user files and Animal Crossing
and Super Smash brothers for 3D. I got animal crossing cia to install and finaly
to run. But the graphics were black!! I think this windows install must have some kind
of display issues... Weird!! I would like to try to reinstall it andmaybe hunt for
drivers soon. The music worked though! with a little bit of slowdown.
