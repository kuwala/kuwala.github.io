    <p>Hello world. Its Daniel here. Time for another journal. Yesterday
      was a really swell day. I jogged a bunch hungout with john made plans to
      make our lifes better. WE gotta keep dreaming and keep moving forward. Playing
      Learning Making and sharing. The skills I Want to build up are game development skills
      with a focus on programming. I am striving to keep my independece as an independent
      creator. Thats what I really want. To build up my own world of projects and things
      that I can put together into fun packages for people. I want to get compensated for it.
      </p>
      <p>Self control can be really challenging, especially with my ADD and Anxiety And
      Depresssion. I have quit a soup of feelings and emotions. Although at times I think
      its not enough and I am scared to continue I dont think I will succeed, I know that
      if I keep trying and dont give up I will succeed.</p>
      <p>My take on life is a super hard one. Like my father said "Artists dont have it easy"
      Im going to stay strong and be optomistic. If I took the easy path it would be boring
      and uninteresting, thats why I am here. That is why I struggle and push my self forward.</p>
      <p>Plans for the day</p>
      <h3>Boring Neccery stuff</h3>
      <ul>

        wrist pain from typing a lot.</p>
      <h3>Rewards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Go jog and see the sunset at some park</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Feelings:::::: My feelings are a lot more down then yesterdays. Kind of bad
        and directionless. I dont feel excited about working on improving my life
        or on programming. I think it might be because I have implemented what I
        thought of at work and then I got stuck. And I need to get passed the blockade,
        and keep working on it. I want to see results!!...</p>

      <p>What is this feeling telling me? I need to spend some time thinking about
        the programming problem and push forward from that. I am also want to write
        down a quick plan of action and check in on what I have already done. this
        might be a good use of the physical journal or</p>

        <p> I didn't
        want to get out of bed. But I did and did the jog with john. I went to bed
        exhausted listening to a podcast and didnt even brush my teeth. Which caused
        me to wakeup around 6 am to go do that. Then I had it rough trying to get to
        sleep. But I did end up having lots of dreams and even a luicid dream about
        woundering around in an underground building complex looking for serge. The
        set of dreams ended with a dream of me popping a giant zit that was taking
        all of existance.</p>
        <p>I did a thing, now to reward myself</p>
