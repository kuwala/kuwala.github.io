          Making your own hardware controller interface for Processing, Puredata/Max/MSP and beyond. A beginner - intermediate workshop where attendees will learn how to make a Arduino based physical controller with buttons, potentiometers (knobs) and light sensors as input. Then I will show them how to add a library to make the controller send MIDI or joystick data over usb to a computer running Processing.

Attendees will walk away with a proof of concept controller on a breadboard that they can use to control a Demo Processing sketch. They will be able to move shapes around in the sketch by pressing the buttons and change size and color of the shapes with sensors like the light sensor.





          I have been developing little games and experiences for myself and friends for many years.

I believe in designing and programming hardware and software together. I love working with my hands


How this fellowship would benefit my practice as an artist.

The benefits I am interested in are engageing with other artists and working in a studio.
As an emerging artist the support of open signal would be a tramendus help
in giving me the space and resources to make my interactive LED installation.
The workshops and community will give me good apportinity to better myself.

How I will engage with open singals community.

I have made great connections with people I have meet at opensignal events like altcade
and I can't wait to make more. Becoming a fellow will allow me to spend lots of
time onsite making, learning, and participating in other creator's events. After Enjoying a
night of art games at altcade I made friends with Yori Kvitchko and Hanna Piper Burns. Then I
volunteered to help them with the next altcade. I illustrated and printed a zine
with a drawing for every game shown. I am excited to cross polinate my favorite communities
in portland like Makers from PDX Hacker Space and Portland Indie Game Squad.

How My practice relates to new Media.

The subset of new media that I work with is interactive art.
I work with microcontrollers, LED strips, video games, and DIY synthesizers. I enjoy making my own systems
with software like PureData, Processing, and Arduino. My works explore User
Interfaces and audio visual feed back. I make hand held electronics that mix synth
interfaces with video games. My recent work like 'Sphinx Cat' explores what it means to design hardware
and software together and enables users play and discovery.

I have made devices that communicate with others via MIDI, OSC, Serial, and python.


<h2>What project would you complete while in Fellowship, in both form and content</h2>

My project would comprise of a interactive Audio LED and projection installation that is a room sized synth.
The led strip, about 10 meters around the room would acts as a display for a simmulation based lights and sound.
The simulation would have agents that act on their own like random movers and other agents
that people can controll. For example an agent I call a plant is a segment of LEDS that are green
and they grow in length every few seconds to take up more space and illuminate the room green. Another
agent is a snake that is red that moves around on the strip and eats the plants.
Based on how big the plant was the snake sends a MIDI note to the connected computer
that will play a synth sound to fill the room. This way the strip simmulates digital
life and acts in a way like a sequencer. Once the basics are working data can
be fed into the simulation to trigger creation of agents. For example the wind direction
and speed in the real world can be used to alter the color and play a static sweeping sound.

The audience is able to interact with the simmulation by using some controllers or
usb midi compatible devices.

Using a Teensy microcontroller I will make some custom interfaces with buttons and knobs to place new agents into the simmulation. As
the audience is doing this they will interact with the simulation and change the light and sound enviroment of the room. the agents will
move along the strip and fill the room with lights and sounds.

The main technology to make this would be a RaspberryPi(or laptop) with PureData,
a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller for user input and running the simmulation to controller the LED strips.
WS2811 (NEOPixel) Led strips and a power suplly to light the room.


How Open Signal's facilities and resources would help you achieve this.

Open Signal can help by providing the space needed to work on the installation.
My process involves a lot of testing having people around to jump in and try it
out while it is in progress would be a lot of help.

stream of conciousness
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


          <p>I have been developing little games and experimental pieces of art
          for the last couple of years.</p>

          Things I am excited about.


          I guess I am going to try the stream of conciousness writing. To put down
          some of my thoughts and worries and things that I am thinking about. So that
          I am not stuck. How will I benefit from being a new media fellow. well
          I really like the intersection of art and tech. thats why I have been
          a huge fan of video games as creative mediums. Mediums for the artist
          to create interesting new things that could not have been possible
          and mediums for new experiences with the audiance.

          One of the main points of interest I have is with simmulation. games
          can create a world that is not just recorded in a linear fasion like a
          movie or a tv show. But by allowing for interaction from the audience
          the audience memember gets to choose their own path. And if a game is
          designed with exploration or play in mind a player may come with their
          own questions and challenges to solve.

          The a sufficently detailed game can allow for simmulations of hypothetical
          events. For example in the sims the player can recreate their own life
          by creating a home and putting themselves and their friends as characters
          in that world. Then they can tweek the particular details of their characters.
          for example their friends can be really greedy and one is a hardworker,
          and the other is a dreamer. and they can set those characteristsic and
          let the game play it self out. guiding the characters and their development
          through out the whole thing.

          A game or a work of art with a sufficently dynamic world can engage with
          the audience/gamer to allow them to dream up of ideas and try them out

          What I am trying to make is a LED world. With simple but dynamic
          characters in it. This world would be the world of lights on a LED strip
          it. Lights as creatures living in a simulation. The LED lights can move
          around like a snake. Other lights can represent plants growing. Some Lights
          can be influenced by real world effects. Like the weather. If it is windy
          the wind direction can change the direction of blue lights moving on the strip.


          The audience members would be encouraged to interact with the simmulation
          as well. Some characters on the strip can be controlled by controllers
          with dials and buttons. The characters would be little segments of Lights
          moving in the direction the aidence wants. Some could place down food pellets
          or plant plants. And others could generate music

          My main goal is to get people to think about the electronic world
          around them as a dynamic system. We are on the cusp of smart homes
          and smart lighting and smart everything. These things are not very smart
          to be honest and they dont need to be smart. They just need to be made
          with concideration to people.

          I do believe that digital life is emerging all around us and if we become
          aware of it we can began to interact with it in interesting ways.
