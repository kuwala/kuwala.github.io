Formatting: A journal entry again.


I am writing things again. Its been a while, huh?
Well its weird because I am creating this big structure of written words...newText
text files and such. But I am not ture what its all for. Kind of a nervous stream
of conciousness that I have developed recently. To just Type things That I am
thinking its like a way for my mind to try and store itself digital. To maybe
perserve its ideas and thought pattterns into the future.

2# Creating things is a form of time travel.

I got distracted and started looking at laptops.... I guess I am not too happy
with the laptop I have. Its a bit slow, it gets way to hot and is noisy.

Gah its 5:55pm already. Man I get distracted too easily. This upsets me because
I think I am wasting time being discracted or entertaining ideas only part of the
way. I am not going to buy a laptop anytime soon. I need at least $700 extra to
buy one. :/ Maybe I should sell my broken macbook for what ever I can get.
Maybe I should open it up. I am fairly sure that I cant fix the water damage
and that it might be causing more and more harm as I wait. Its probably waaay
too late as of now. It went bad around winter time.
