<h1>Learning Haml and Journaling</h1>
<p>This is going to be a neat thing. I wanted to up my game with my webdev</p>
and I feel like with this I am learning more stuff and utalizing good tech.
Cool beans!
<h2>I want to develop the skills to be wanted at companies like NewRelic</h2>
<p>It may not be something I totally want to do now. But I want that as</p>
an option. So that I am a desired web dev. If I am desired and a company
has an opening for a interface developer that would be steller. I would
not mind going to work full time if it was something beauitiful elegent
and rewarding. now if only I would care enough to spell. HahaQ!
