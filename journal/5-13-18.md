# Journal Time Every time
I have been having some good days lately. That involved getting work done
hanging out with people I really care about. Actually allowing myself to go to
the partys I want to. Making food for people. Bonding with my house family.

Yesterday I hung out with Amber Case and we talked about my breakup with stephanie.
Her advice is for me to giver her as much space as possible. We played music together
her on her iphone using korg iDS-10 or something. Me on Reason and later Maschine.
John on the OP-1.


I have been sleeping well too. 7-9 hrs. Today I am doing some risky and well
needed

At the end of the night I talked to Amalia for an hour-ish.
Afterwards I doodled a sketch of a room for my Daniel's Delirium rogue like.
After all these hangouts I really do feel like great that I am around a lot of
good people its a great space. And I am loved here too!

I got a busy day Ahead maybe I will write about it when I get home.

oh oh I should squize in a tiny bit of music with john. If that is possible.
I have to be somewhere really soon....hmm lets not rush it. Oh fuck it we should.
WE only live once. WOLO.
