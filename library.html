				<h1>share share share</h1>
				<p> Welcome to Daniel's shared library of books. My dream is to inspire
				my friends and family young and old to share and learn new things.
				Anyone can enjoy books even if they cant read. There is no point in keeping
				all these books to myself, so I spread the love to you. I hope these books
				find you and bring you a little bit of joy and wonder of the world. </p>

				<h3>Values:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Books want to be read.</li>
					<li>Books want to be shared.</li>
					<li>Books don't belove to any one person.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Some of my favorite things in this world are books and so I made this project
				to share my love for books and libraries with my friends and family and
				inspire them to share with their friends and family, and so on and on.
				It does not have to stop there, you too can share books.
				If you have received a book as a gift from me or someone, be kind and return the
				favor by giving a book to someone else. Try to find someone that could use a
				gift and give them one of these books. You can make their day better and even
				influence their life for the better. The power is in your hands now.</p>

				<h3> Non-comprehensive list of books I have given away: </h3>

				<p>I am in the process of developing a way to gently track where a book has been.
				How many hands it has exchanged and where it should go. Like a old style library
				check-in-out log sheet. Here are some QR-codes I want to use. Stay tuned.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Do's and Dont's</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Do keep the book as long as you like </li>
					<li>Don't be reckless with the books unless it brings you lots of fun</li>
					<li>Do share pictures and swap book stories</li>
					<li>Don't keep a book too long instead pass it along to other people</li>
					<li>Do write in the margines, highlight, scribble and doodle in the books</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Where I have purchased my books: </h3>
				<p>Powell's Books, Titlewave Bookstore.</p>
