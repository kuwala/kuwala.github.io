### Danny's Site 2017
This site is a place to share my text files, images, and collections.
I want to share them in a fun and interesting way. Using games and
interactivity I want to further study the way people can interact
and control a ~~website~~ digital portfolio with novel and unusual ways.
It should be a delightful and inspiring experience.
