				<h1>Yarn Junkie ep1</h1>
				<h3>Hacking my clothes to better suit what I want. - June 5th 2017</h3>

				<p>Today at the beach I needed shorts but I have not owned a pair in several years.
				So I decided to take the plung and make my own shorts as quickly and thirfty
				as possible. I often carry a pair of scizzors with me, so I cut off the
			 	lower halfs of my old jeans to make new shorts. This worked well
				and I am happy with how they turned out.
				</p>

				<h4>Tonight I also played with the idea of making a bracelet.</h4>

				<p>I drew some sketchs for ideas of electronic bead - type modules that
				you can wire together to make a functional bracelet. That idea is a bit
				in the future so I seattled for using a yarn scrap I had and wrapping it
				around my wrist to make a bracelet. This one will fall off on its own or
				will need to be cut off when the wearer gets bored. </p>

				<h2>⏃△Metronome Ideas△⏅✆</h2>
					<h4>5-21-17</h4>
				<p>Here I tried to make some music with a metronome and an echo effect. I was able to make some pleasent sounds that I liked, the most important thing that came out of this was the idea to make an instrument with several metronomes that you can controll precisely and they output a midi note / trigger to play sound devices.</p>

					<h1>Hebcon - Dorkbot</h1>
					<h4>5-1-17</h4>
					<p>Hebocon was a blast. I arrived not prepared for the event, and promptly
					found out that there is a build time before the event for putting together a
					robot the day of. I was super into that and pompty jumped on board. I found things
					around ^H to use as meterials to build. Big thanks to Bill for bring some spare
					motors and battery parts for people to use. I worked on the bot for nearly 2.5 hours and half way
					through Gary joined in to help. The main issue we had to over come was the big wheel axel would not
					stick to the moter. This caused the wheels to slip. Gary thought of a good solution to it by using friction
					from jamming thin metal rods in between the axel and motor. That worked great and together we finished the bot with
					no time to spare. We dubbed it Popcorn-Bot after one of the materials Gary wimsically used to create padding pads for
					supporting the heavy battery on top of the motor. In the end our bot ended up winning. Woohoo.

						<li>Window Motor</li>
						<li>9v battery</li>

					<p>
					Big thanks to my partner in bot creation Gary, Bill for bring the parts and
					sparking ideas, Brian for hosting the whole event and making things run
					smoothly and control H for the awesome environment.
