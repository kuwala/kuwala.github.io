					<h1>Hebcon - Dorkbot</h1>
					<h4>5-1-17</h4>
					<p>Hebocon was a blast. I arrived not prepared for the event, and promptly
					found out that there is a build time before the event for putting together a
					robot the day of. I was super into that and pompty jumped on board. I found things
					around ^H to use as meterials to build. Big thanks to Bill for bring some spare
					motors and battery parts for people to use. I worked on the bot for nearly 2.5 hours and half way
					through Gary joined in to help. The main issue we had to over come was the big wheel axel would not
					stick to the moter. This caused the wheels to slip. Gary thought of a good solution to it by using friction
					from jamming thin metal rods in between the axel and motor. That worked great and together we finished the bot with
					no time to spare. We dubbed it Popcorn-Bot after one of the materials Gary wimsically used to create padding pads for
					supporting the heavy battery on top of the motor. In the end our bot ended up winning. Woohoo.
